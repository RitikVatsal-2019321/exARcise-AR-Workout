exARcise- An AR Workout App For Windows/ Android/ iOS

exARcise is a physical workout game that helps you exercise in a fun and enjoyable way. The app tracks your body and guides you to move your arms to certain marked regions, and gives points based on how long you are able to hold that pose. There are bonus points if you manage to hold both your arms in the required position.

Technical Details-
The app is built on Unity using an open-source TensorFlow lite library- BlazePose for full body tracking (Thanks to github user asus4 for their port). To get a more detailed idea of what is happening behind the scenes, you can visit the "Peek under the hood" section in the app, which gives live feed of how Computer Vision works on each frame of the image. I have added support for both cameras in the mobile device for increased convenience.
I have added an NCS Upbeat song to motivate the user to exercise, as well as sound pings for each point you get so that you can keep the phone at an adequate distance!
